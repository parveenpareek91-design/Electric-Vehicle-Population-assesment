# Electric Vehicle Population Assessment 
 🚀 Project Overview
This project performs *real-world assessment of Electric Vehicle (EV) population data** using Python.  
The goal is to analyze trends, regional distribution, adoption growth, and key patterns in the dataset to generate meaningful insights for decision-making.
 Project Objective
- Analyze EV adoption and growth trends over time
- Understand geographic and demographic distribution
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualize insights using charts and statistical summaries
- Showcase practical **Data Analytics skills for job transition into Data Analyst roles**
